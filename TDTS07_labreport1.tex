\section{Trafficlight}
The traffic light consists of four sensors which are connected to a
controller that can at the right moment give a green signal on a
light where a car is waiting. The cars are generated from an input
file which is read by the car generator,input_gen, and which car is
granted green light is read by the monitor that writes to an output
file.
\subsection{input_gen}
The input generator simply reads a text document and inputs cars from
north, south, east or west.
\subsection{sensor}
The sensor detects when a car have arrived at its trafficlight and
sends a signal to the controller that it has a car waiting.

\section{Tests}
To verify that our traffic light is correct two different simulations
have been executed. One to verify that every car is granted passage
and one to see that a single car from one direction can dissappear when
many arrives from.
